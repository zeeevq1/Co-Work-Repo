        <h2 class="hero-h2">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="hero-text">
          Founded in <b>Italy in 2018</b>, Brew Haven started as a small
          family-run café nestled in the heart of <b>Tuscany</b>. Inspired by
          the Italian love for quality coffee and community, we brought that
          same spirit to every cup we serve.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-text">
          From handcrafted <b>espresso</b> to cozy spaces filled with warmth,
          our mission is to blend tradition with modern taste, offering a place
          where everyone can feel at home—
          <em><b>no matter where they are in the world.</b></em>

          <p class="hero-text">
            Our journey began with a simple idea: to create a space where coffee
            lovers could come together and enjoy the finest brews. We started
            with a small cart in a bustling market, serving handcrafted drinks
            made from the best beans we could find.

          <h2 class="chapter">Chapter 2: Growth and Community</h2>
          <p class="hero-text">
            As our reputation grew, so did our community. We began hosting
            events, workshops, and tastings, bringing people together to share
            their love for coffee. Our café became a hub for creativity and
            connection.

            As we look to the future, we are committed to innovation and
            sustainability. We believe in using technology to enhance the coffee
            experience, from sourcing the best beans to creating a seamless
